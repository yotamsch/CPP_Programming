list of cases:
general bug: joker do
case1: all flags of the opponent are captured
case2: all moving pieces of the opponent are eaten
case3: a tie- both moves input files done without a winner
case4: a tie- all flags are eaten by both players in position files
case5: bad positioning input file for player 1 line 3
case6: bad positioning input files for both players - player 1: line 3, player 2: line 3
case7: bad moves input file for player 2 line 1 - with flags at same position
case9: all flags of the opponent are captured with joker change
case8: input file is missing or cannot be opened (all of them were missing)
case10: bad moves input file for player 2 line 1
case11: joker change, with player1 winning by eating the flag of player 2
case12: input file is missing or cannot be opened (some of them were missing)
case13: all moving pieces of the opponent are eaten && there is a joker who wants to be R at 1,1 in player1 while there is a R at 1,1 in player2
case14: all moving pieces are at same position and same type for the two players, should be a tie and all pieces should be deleted except flags
case15: bomb check
Results:
in cases 5,6,7 board output is not improtant(according to Amir in forum) because some file is incorrect

-case 1 OK

-case2 OK

-case4 OK. same as case 7: flags are dead at initial state and game ends in a tie

-case5 OK

-case6 fails: should check both files and announce that both are
 bad(instead it announces only about the first file it checks).

-case7 fails: should check moves files first of all and because one of them is bad
 should stop and announce player 1 as winner(instead it's making a move without
 considering correctness of moves-files.  what should 
 happen first: check validity of file or make a tie because of the initial state??

-case8 fail: (no output file should be created) segmentation fault core dumped

-case9 fail: doesn't recognize joker change as a correct one

-case10 OK

-case11 fail: whenever there's a joker that wants to change representation, it is caught as a bad move

-case12 fail  segmentation fault core dumped same as case8

-case13 fail: general note/error: a small letter j is printed as a player1 piece although it should be J
 the wrong part is: a joker that sits in the same power position of his opponent should be deleted just like the opponent 

-case14 semi fail: where the hell does this j come from!?? the rest is ok
-case15: fail, bomb doesnt kill scissors
